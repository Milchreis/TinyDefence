# TinyDefence

Simple TowerDefence clone written in Python and PyGame.

## Goal

I would get a funny access to Python and the simple graphical programming.
TowerDefence is based on a simple princip and offers a lot of problems for beginners.
TinyDefence should be the way for trying python and learn more about it. 

Also, this project should be a little playground for Python and Github.
